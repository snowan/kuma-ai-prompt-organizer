# **AI Prompt Manager Application: Development Plan**

## **1. Project Overview**

**Goal:** To develop a web application for managing AI prompts, allowing users to create, read, update, delete (CRUD), categorize, and label prompts. The system will feature de-duplication of similar prompts and provide robust search capabilities.

**Core Features:**

* **Prompt Management:** Full CRUD operations for prompts.  
* **Categorization:** Assign prompts to predefined or user-defined categories (e.g., Tech, Marketing, Sales, Learning).  
* **Labeling/Tagging:** Add multiple labels/tags to prompts for fine-grained organization.  
* **De-duplication:** Identify and alert users about similar or identical prompts during creation.  
* **Search & Filtering:** Search prompts by content, category, and labels.  
* **User Interface:** A minimalistic, beautiful, and intuitive UI.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
* **Backend:** Python (using Flask or FastAPI)  
* **Database:** SQLite  
* **Text Similarity (for De-duplication):** Python library like thefuzz (or fuzzywuzzy).

## **2. Detailed Execution Plan**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundational Work (Estimated: 1 Week)**

1. **Development Environment Setup:**  
   * Install Node.js, npm/yarn for frontend.  
   * Install Python, pip for backend.  
   * Set up a Python virtual environment (e.g., venv).  
   * Install code editor (e.g., VS Code) with relevant extensions.  
2. **Project Initialization:**  
   * Frontend: Create a new React project (e.g., using Vite: npm create vite@latest my-prompt-app -- --template react-ts or npx create-react-app my-prompt-app).  
   * Backend: Set up a basic Python project structure for Flask or FastAPI.  
   * Version Control: Initialize a Git repository and create initial commit.  
3. **Tailwind CSS Integration:**  
   * Install and configure Tailwind CSS in the React project.  
4. **Database Schema Design (SQLite):**  
   * **prompts table:**  
     * id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)  
     * title (TEXT, NOT NULL)  
     * prompt\_text (TEXT, NOT NULL)  
     * category\_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES categories(id))  
     * created\_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP)  
     * updated\_at (DATETIME, DEFAULT CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP)  
   * **categories table:**  
     * id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)  
     * name (TEXT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)  
   * **labels table:**  
     * id (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT)  
     * name (TEXT, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)  
   * **prompt\_labels table (Junction Table for Many-to-Many relationship):**  
     * prompt\_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES prompts(id))  
     * label\_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES labels(id))  
     * PRIMARY KEY (prompt\_id, label\_id)  
5. **Initial Backend Setup:**  
   * Implement basic database connection logic for SQLite.  
   * Set up initial migration scripts if using an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy with Alembic).

### **Phase 2: Backend API Development (Estimated: 2-3 Weeks)**

1. **Core API Endpoints (RESTful principles):**  
   * **Prompts (/api/prompts):**  
     * POST /: Create a new prompt (includes de-duplication check).  
     * GET /: Get all prompts (with pagination, filtering by category/label).  
     * GET /\<prompt\_id\>: Get a single prompt by ID.  
     * PUT /\<prompt\_id\>: Update an existing prompt.  
     * DELETE /\<prompt\_id\>: Delete a prompt.  
   * **Categories (/api/categories):**  
     * POST /: Create a new category.  
     * GET /: Get all categories.  
     * PUT /\<category\_id\>: Update a category.  
     * DELETE /\<category\_id\>: Delete a category (consider handling prompts in this category).  
   * **Labels (/api/labels):**  
     * POST /: Create a new label.  
     * GET /: Get all labels.  
     * PUT /\<label\_id\>: Update a label.  
     * DELETE /\<label\_id\>: Delete a label.  
2. **De-duplication Logic Implementation:**  
   * Integrate thefuzz or a similar library.  
   * On prompt creation (POST /api/prompts):  
     * Before saving, compare the new prompt text against existing prompts.  
     * Use a similarity scoring method (e.g., fuzz.token\_set\_ratio).  
     * Define a similarity threshold (e.g., 90%).  
     * If similarity exceeds the threshold, return a specific response (e.g., 409 Conflict) with details of the similar prompt(s), allowing the frontend to notify the user.  
3. **Search Functionality Backend:**  
   * Implement search logic in GET /api/prompts to filter by keywords in title and prompt\_text.  
   * Allow filtering by category\_id and label\_ids.  
4. **Database Interaction:**  
   * Implement CRUD operations for each entity using SQLite. Consider using an ORM like SQLAlchemy for easier database management.  
5. **API Validation and Error Handling:**  
   * Implement input validation for API requests.  
   * Provide clear and consistent error messages.

### **Phase 3: Frontend Development (Estimated: 3-4 Weeks)**

1. **UI/UX Design & Prototyping (Low-fidelity):**  
   * Sketch out basic layouts for key screens:  
     * Main dashboard/Prompt list view.  
     * Prompt detail view.  
     * New/Edit prompt form.  
     * Category/Label management interface.  
   * Focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use.  
2. **Component Structure Planning:**  
   * Break down the UI into reusable React components (e.g., PromptCard, PromptForm, CategorySelector, LabelInput, SearchBar, Sidebar, Navbar).  
3. **Core UI Implementation:**  
   * **Layout:** Main application shell (Navbar, Sidebar, Content Area).  
   * **Prompt List View:**  
     * Display prompts (e.g., in a card or list format).  
     * Implement client-side or server-side pagination.  
     * Integrate search bar and filter controls (for categories, labels).  
   * **Prompt Form (Create/Edit):**  
     * Fields for title, prompt text.  
     * Dropdown for category selection.  
     * Multi-select or tag input for labels.  
     * Save and Cancel buttons.  
   * **Category & Label Management UI:**  
     * Interface to view, add, edit, and delete categories and labels.  
4. **State Management:**  
   * Choose a state management solution (e.g., React Context API for simpler cases, or Zustand/Redux Toolkit for more complex state).  
5. **API Integration:**  
   * Use fetch or a library like axios to communicate with the backend API endpoints.  
   * Handle API responses, loading states, and errors gracefully.  
   * Implement logic to display de-duplication warnings from the backend.  
6. **Styling with Tailwind CSS:**  
   * Apply Tailwind utility classes to style all components.  
   * Ensure a responsive design that works well on various screen sizes.  
   * Focus on achieving the "simplistic and beautiful" aesthetic.  
7. **Routing:**  
   * Implement client-side routing using react-router-dom for navigation between different views.

### **Phase 4: Integration, Testing & Refinement (Estimated: 1-2 Weeks)**

1. **End-to-End Testing:**  
   * Test all user flows: creating prompts, editing, deleting, categorizing, labeling, searching, de-duplication warnings.  
2. **De-duplication Feature Testing:**  
   * Specifically test the de-duplication logic with various similar and distinct prompts.  
   * Adjust similarity threshold if necessary.  
3. **Cross-Browser and Responsiveness Testing:**  
   * Ensure the application works correctly and looks good on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and different device sizes.  
4. **Performance Optimization:**  
   * Identify and address any frontend or backend performance bottlenecks.  
5. **Bug Fixing:**  
   * Address all identified bugs from testing.  
6. **Code Review and Refactoring:**  
   * Review code for clarity, consistency, and best practices.  
   * Refactor as needed.

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation (Estimated: 1 Week)**

1. **Backend Deployment:**  
   * Choose a hosting platform for the Python backend (e.g., Heroku, PythonAnywhere, AWS, Google Cloud).  
   * Configure the production environment.  
   * Deploy the backend application. SQLite might be challenging for some platforms if persistence across deploys is needed without a persistent volume; consider this when choosing. For simple cases or single-instance deployments, it can work.  
2. **Frontend Deployment:**  
   * Build the React application for production (npm run build).  
   * Deploy the static assets to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3).  
3. **Final Configuration:**  
   * Ensure frontend API requests point to the deployed backend URL.  
4. **Documentation:**  
   * **User Documentation:** Basic guide on how to use the application.  
   * **Developer Documentation:**  
     * README.md with project setup, build, and run instructions.  
     * API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI for the backend).  
     * Notes on architecture and key design decisions.

## **4. Key Considerations & Potential Challenges**

* **De-duplication Accuracy:** Fine-tuning the similarity algorithm and threshold will be crucial. It might require iteration based on real-world usage.  
* **Scalability of SQLite:** SQLite is excellent for single-user applications or small-to-medium traffic. If high concurrency or large datasets are anticipated in the future, migrating to a more robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) might be necessary.  
* **User Experience for De-duplication:** The way similar prompts are presented to the user needs to be clear and non-intrusive.  
* **Category/Label Management Complexity:** As the number of categories and labels grows, managing them effectively could become a UI challenge.  
* **Search Performance:** For a large number of prompts, naive search queries might become slow. Consider database indexing or more advanced search solutions if needed.

## **5. Timeline Summary (Approximate)**

* **Phase 1 (Setup):** 1 Week  
* **Phase 2 (Backend):** 2-3 Weeks  
* **Phase 3 (Frontend):** 3-4 Weeks  
* **Phase 4 (Integration & Testing):** 1-2 Weeks  
* **Phase 5 (Deployment & Docs):** 1 Week  
* **Total Estimated Time:** 8-11 Weeks

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap. Flexibility will be important, and adjustments may be needed as the project progresses.
